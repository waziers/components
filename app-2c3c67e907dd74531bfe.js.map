Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\n * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\n * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\n * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\n * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\n * name of the component).\n *\n * ---\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the\n * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\n * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 1 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n *   exiting:  { opacity: 0 },\n *   exited:  { opacity: 0 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {state => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete. Let's take\n * the following example (we'll use the\n * [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook):\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={inProp} timeout={500}>\n *         {state => (\n *           // ...\n *         )}\n *       </Transition>\n *       <button onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state\n * and stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches\n * to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from\n * `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n */\n\nvar Transition =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction (_React$Component) {\n  _inheritsLoose(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n  function Transition(props, context) {\n    var _this;\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call(this, props, context) || this;\n    var parentGroup = context; // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ?

After the\n * transition, matching `*-done` class names are applied to persist the\n * transition state.\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <CSSTransition in={inProp} timeout={200} classNames=\"my-node\">\n *         <div>\n *           {\"I'll receive my-node-* classes\"}\n *         </div>\n *       </CSSTransition>\n *       <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the `in` prop is set to `true`, the child component will first receive\n * the class `example-enter`, then the `example-enter-active` will be added in\n * the next tick. `CSSTransition` [forces a\n * reflow](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\n * between before adding the `example-enter-active`.

Subsequent calls to the throttled function return the\n * result of the last `func` invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is\n * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the throttled function\n * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred\n * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.\n *\n * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n * for details over the differences between `_.throttle` and `_.debounce`.\n *\n * @static\n * @memberOf _\n * @since 0.1.0\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} func The function to throttle.\n * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to throttle invocations to.\n * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n * @param {boolean} [options.leading=true]\n *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n * @returns {Function} Returns the new throttled function.\n * @example\n *\n * // Avoid excessively updating the position while scrolling.\n * jQuery(window).on('scroll', _.throttle(updatePosition, 100));\n *\n * // Invoke `renewToken` when the click event is fired, but not more than once every 5 minutes.\n * var throttled = _.throttle(renewToken, 300000, { 'trailing': false });\n * jQuery(element).on('click', throttled);\n *\n * // Cancel the trailing throttled invocation.\n * jQuery(window).on('popstate', throttled.cancel);\n */\n\nfunction throttle(func, wait, options) {\n  var leading = true,\n      trailing = true;\n\n  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n  }\n\n  if (isObject(options)) {\n    leading = 'leading' in options ? !!options.leading : leading;\n    trailing = 'trailing' in options ? !!options.trailing : trailing;\n  }\n\n  return debounce(func, wait, {\n    'leading': leading,\n    'maxWait': wait,\n    'trailing': trailing\n  });\n}\n\nexport default throttle;","import debounce from \"lodash-es/debounce\";\nimport throttle from \"lodash-es/throttle\";\nexport var listHandle = {\n  debounce: debounce,\n  throttle: throttle\n};\nexport var getHandle = function getHandle(type) {\n  return listHandle[type];\n};\nexport var isFunction = function isFunction(fn) {\n  return typeof fn === 'function';\n};\nexport var isSSR = function isSSR() {\n  return typeof window === 'undefined';\n};\nexport var isDOMElement = function isDOMElement(element) {\n  return element instanceof Element || element instanceof HTMLDocument;\n};","import \"core-js/modules/es6.object.create\";\nimport \"core-js/modules/es6.object.set-prototype-of\";\nimport \"core-js/modules/es6.object.define-property\";\nimport \"core-js/modules/es7.symbol.async-iterator\";\nimport \"core-js/modules/es6.symbol\";\n\nfunction _typeof(obj) {\n  if (typeof Symbol === \"function\" && typeof Symbol.iterator === \"symbol\") {\n    _typeof = function _typeof(obj) {\n      return typeof obj;\n    };\n  } else {\n    _typeof = function _typeof(obj) {\n      return obj && typeof Symbol === \"function\" && obj.constructor === Symbol && obj !== Symbol.prototype ? \"symbol\" : typeof obj;\n    };\n  }\n\n  return _typeof(obj);\n}\n\nfunction _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) {\n  if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) {\n    throw new TypeError(\"Cannot call a class as a function\");\n  }\n}\n\nfunction _defineProperties(target, props) {\n  for (var i = 0; i < props.length; i++) {\n    var descriptor = props[i];\n    descriptor.enumerable = descriptor.enumerable || false;\n    descriptor.configurable = true;\n    if (\"value\" in descriptor) descriptor.writable = true;\n    Object.defineProperty(target, descriptor.key, descriptor);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction _createClass(Constructor, protoProps, staticProps) {\n  if (protoProps) _defineProperties(Constructor.prototype, protoProps);\n  if (staticProps) _defineProperties(Constructor, staticProps);\n  return Constructor;\n}\n\nfunction _possibleConstructorReturn(self, call) {\n  if (call && (_typeof(call) === \"object\" || typeof call === \"function\")) {\n    return call;\n  }\n\n  return _assertThisInitialized(self);\n}\n\nfunction _assertThisInitialized(self) {\n  if (self === void 0) {\n    throw new ReferenceError(\"this hasn't been initialised - super() hasn't been called\");\n  }\n\n  return self;\n}\n\nfunction _getPrototypeOf(o) {\n  _getPrototypeOf = Object.setPrototypeOf ?
